# never drift from CI.
#
# Every repository of the split family accepts the same lane names:
#   required  fast  security  audit  gates  (all is an alias of gates)
# plus the legacy lane names kept for callers that still pass them. With no
# argument the required lane runs, because that is the gate every change has
# to pass. `--list` prints the accepted lanes and `--which [lane]` prints the
# script a lane resolves to, so the contract can be probed without running it.
